# Beef-and-walking
 Climate change mitigation and adaptation require changes to our overall lifestyle, including what we eat and how we travel. It appears to be an obvious truth that walking, running, or cycling instead of driving dramatically reduces the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHG). However, eating a diet rich in foods of animal origin has been shown to drastically reduce environmental benefits of cycling. I advance the existing literature of the benefits human powered transportation in four ways. First, by using accurate measures of energy expenditure in cycling instead of customary crude estimates. Second, I extend the analysis to environmental benefits to walking and running. Third, I use comprehensive measurements of GHGs in food production, including methane, to assess the full environmental impact of human powered transport. Finally, I compare the GHG impact of human powered transportation to that of driving and flying using realistic data on diets for a select group of countries. To maximize the benefits of human powered transport, I suggest imposing excise taxes on meat and other animal products with concommitant measures to assist the low income househyolds, and eliminating direct and indirect subsidies of animal sourced foods.
